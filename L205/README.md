## Commands
Along with the earlier 4 commands. We have new command `sentence_rayu();`.

```C
number_rayu(42);
space_kottu();
enter_kottu();
hyphen_kottu();
sentence_rayu("Relentless commitment.");
```

## Task

Extend the program to make _the computer type as follows_.

```
Core quality for success?
Relentless commitment.

vakkasari
vakkasari commit
vakkasari commit ayitey
vakkasari commit ayitey na 
vakkasari commit ayitey na maata
vakkasari commit ayitey na maata neney
vakkasari commit ayitey na maata neney vinanu
```

## Hint: When tests fail
In case of test failed, check the `Results`.  
If everythings looks same, then make sure you tell the computer to type an `enter key after last line` at the end.  

## Submit your code
Once you got the expected output. Submit your code.  
When you submit it will prompt you to view test cases.   

Click `Run tests` button.  
Once tests pass click on `Submit`.
