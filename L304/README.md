## Task

Extend the program to make _the computer type as follows_.

```
5 % 3 = 2
4 % 3 = 1
3 % 3 = 0
2 % 3 = 2
1 % 3 = 1

5 / 3 = 1
4 / 3 = 1
3 / 3 = 1
2 / 3 = 0
1 / 3 = 0

``` 

To get the first line in the output, we can use commands in the following manner.  
```C
sentence_rayu("5 % 3 = ");
number_rayu(5 % 3);
enter_kottu();
```
Write the remaining code in similar fashion.  

## Submit your code

When you submit it will prompt you to view test cases.   

Click `Run tests` button.
