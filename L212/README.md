## Improve your previous question code
Copy the code that you have written for `L#2:11.Pattern` question. And modify the code to make the computer print this pattern.

You can only use the following 4 commands.

```C
number_rayu(42);
space_kottu();
enter_kottu();

## Hint: copy the code for typing the first line
Once you write commands to get the output for the first line. Copy the code and just change the numbers that needs to be displayed.

Once you got the expected output. Submit your code.  
When you submit it will prompt you to `View tests`.  

Click on `View tests` and then click on `Run tests` button.
