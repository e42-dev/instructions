# Use 4 commands to make the computer type the pattern for you

## Commands
Along with the earlier commands, you can also use the new command `hyphen_kottu();` to make the computer type a `hyphen`.

## Commands
Now we have one more new command `hyphen_kottu();` which will tell the computer to type the `hyphen key`. We can use the following 4 commands to make the computer type needed pattern

```C
number_rayu(42);
space_kottu();
enter_kottu();
hyphen_kottu();
```

## Task

Now you need to give a sequence of commands in such a way that _the computer will type as follows_.

```
000 - 0
001 - 1
100 - 4
111 - 7

```

## Hint: When tests fail
In case of test failed, check the `Results`.  
If everythings looks same, then make sure you tell the computer to type an enter key after `111 - 7` line at the end.  

## Submit your code
Once you got the expected output. Submit your code.  
When you submit it will prompt you to view test cases.   

Click `Run tests` button.  
Once tests pass click on `Submit`.
