## Commands
You can use only these 2 commands.

```C
sentence_rayu("      +");
enter_kottu();
```

## Task

Now you need to give a sequence of commands in such a way that _the computer will type as follows_.

```
      +
     - -
    * * *
   / / / /
  + + + + +
   / / / /
    * * *
     - -
      +
```


## Hint: When tests fail
In case of test failed, check the `Results`.   

If everythings looks same, then make sure you tell the computer to type an enter key after + at the end.  

## Submit your code
Once you got the expected output. Submit your code.  
When you submit it will prompt you to `View tests`.  

Click on `View tests` and then click on `Run tests` button.  

Once tests pass click on `Submit`.
