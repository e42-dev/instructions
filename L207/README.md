## Commands
You can use only these 3 commands.

```C
number_rayu(42);
space_kottu();
enter_kottu();
```

## Task

Now you need to give a sequence of commands in such a way that _the computer will type as follows_.

```
42

1
1 2
1 2  3
1 2  3   4

      1
     2 2
   3  3  3
4   4   4   4

42

```


## Hint: When tests fail
In case of test failed, check the `Results`.   

If everythings looks same, then make sure you tell the computer to type an enter key after number 42 at the end.  

## Submit your code
Once you got the expected output. Submit your code.  
When you submit it will prompt you to `View tests`.  

Click on `View tests` and then click on `Run tests` button.  

Once tests pass click on `Submit`.
