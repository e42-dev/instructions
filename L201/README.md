## Sample program

```C
#include "భవిష్యత్తులో.నేను"

START

  number_rayu(42);
  enter_kottu();

STOP
```

_This program's output:_
```
42
```

## Options

If you cannot understand the first line of the program.
```C
#include "భవిష్యత్తులో.నేను"
```
Replace the above line with this line.
```C
#include "future.me"
```

## Commands
We can give any of these 2 commands to the computer. Any number of times.

```C
number_rayu(42);
enter_kottu();
```

## Task

Now you need to give a sequence of commands in such a way that _the computer will type as follows_.

```
42

1
2

1
12
123

42

```

## Hint: When tests fail
In case of test failed, check the `Results`.   

If everythings looks same, then make sure you tell the computer to type an enter key after number 42 at the end.  


## Submit your code
Once you got the expected output. Submit your code.  
When you submit it will prompt you to `View tests`.  

Click on `View tests` and then click on `Run tests` button.  

Once tests pass click on `Submit`.
