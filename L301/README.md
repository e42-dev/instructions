## Commands
You can use these 3 commands only.

```C

## Task

Extend the program to make _the computer type as follows_.

```
The sum of 5 and 3 is 8.
3 substracted from 5 is 2.
The product of 5 and 3 is 15.
5 divided by 3 the quotient is 1.
5 divided by 3 the remainder is 2.
``` 

To get the first line in the output, we can use commands in the following manner.  
```C
sentence_rayu("The sum of 5 and 3 is ");
number_rayu(5+3);
sentence_rayu(".");
enter_kottu();
```
Write the remaining code in similar fashion.  
Using `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.  

`+` Addition  
`-` Substraction  
`*` Multiplication  
`/` Quotient    
`%` Remainder
