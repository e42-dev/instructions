```C
number_rayu(42);
space_kottu();
enter_kottu();

## Hint: When tests fail
In case of test failed, check the `Results`.  
If everythings looks same, then make sure you tell the computer to type an enter key after 2 - 10 - 20` line at the end.  

## Submit your code
Once you got the expected output. Submit your code.  
When you submit it will prompt you to view test cases.
